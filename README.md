# How-to-become-a-legend
rogue like game

Next programming steps.

Test pathfinding with more obstacles
Add monsters, pathfinding should also be set in monster spots

Monsters should move towards the lowest number, lowest towards hero
Monster needs to know path of movement.
Make monster turn after hero moved.
    -- for this we need a list of monsters.
    -- then for each monster do their action
    -- monsters have settled damage for now and always move towards hero or attack when next to it

Give hero and monster hit-points. Damage removes hit-points.
Make a monster death animation.

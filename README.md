# How-to-become-a-legend
rogue like game

Next programming steps.
    

Make monster turn after hero moved.
    -- for this we need a list of monsters.
    -- then for each monster do their action
    -- monsters have settled damage for now and always move towards hero or attack when next to it

Give hero and monster hit-points. Damage removes hit-points.
Make a monster death animation.
Make pathfinding so monsters move towards lowest number
Monster needs to know path of movement.

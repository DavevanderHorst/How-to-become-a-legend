rogue like game

Next programming steps.
    

Make monster turn after hero moved.
    -- for this we need a list of monsters.
    -- then for each monster do their action
first dummy only, they don't move, but attack for 1.
Make a new monster, that one moves.
monster will attack when next to hero, or move towards hero.
Monster needs to know path of movement.
Give hero and monster hit-points. Damage removes hit-points.
Make a monster death animation.

# How-to-become-a-legend
rogue like game

Next programming steps.

Make monster turn after hero moved.    
    -- monster without a path, so blocked by other monster for example, don't move. make confused animation    
    -- 2 moving monsters can move into each other. Fix this.

Give hero and monster hit-points. Damage removes hit-points.
Make a monster death animation.



IDEAS!

Monster always moves now right around, so with 2 same shortest roads, it takes always same. Make a list with directions,
        and go around the direction that's head, and remove and add to the back of the list.
Sticky terrain, terrain with a chance to get stick...
